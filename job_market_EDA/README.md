## Big Data Analytics Skills: Analyzing Post-Pandemic Job Market Trends

This project investigates the shifting skill requirements for Big Data Analytics professionals, particularly in the context of the post-COVID-19 job market. By analyzing job postings, this study identifies key trends in demanded skills, offering insights for students and professionals in the field.

### Overview
The project uses web scraping techniques to collect data from job postings on platforms like Indeed.com. The collected data is then analyzed using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to identify trends in skill demands. The project compares these findings with pre-pandemic research to highlight how the industry's needs have evolved.

### Key Components

Data Collection
* Job postings are scraped from Indeed.com using keywords "Data Science" and "Big Data Analytics" for positions in Canada.
* Data collected includes job title, company, date posted, location, and job requirements.
* The data collection was conducted during June and July 2023, resulting in 193 job postings.

Data Preprocessing
* The scraped data is cleaned and preprocessed using Python.
* Specific skills mentioned in job requirements are extracted and categorized into 11 predefined categories.
* More than 1200 job-skill combinations are obtained.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Various visualization techniques, including word clouds, bar charts, histograms, and radar charts are used to analyze the data.
* The analysis focuses on skill frequencies, skill categories, geographical distribution of jobs, and relationships between different skills.
* The results of the EDA are presented using frequency graphs.

### Results
* The most frequently mentioned terms in job postings include "data," "analytics," "machine learning," and "business," indicating the interdisciplinary nature of Big Data Analytics roles.
* "Data Visualization", "Statistics & Modeling," and "Machine Learning & AI" are among the most frequently mentioned skill categories, highlighting a strong industry focus on these areas.
* Machine Learning and AI is a key area of focus, with specific skills like "machine learning", "AI", and "deep learning" being highly sought after.
* Most job postings require a moderate number of skills. The average number of skills per job posting is around 10.
* The top skill pairs often include Python, which appears frequently with skills like machine learning, communication, and SQL.
* Provinces with large tech sectors, such as Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia, have a higher concentration of job postings, with Ontario having the majority of job posts.
* Skill demands vary across provinces, with Quebec appearing to look for a more complete profile, while most provinces focus mainly on Machine Learning and AI.
* There is a strong demand for skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence, reflecting their growing importance across industries.
* The job market requires a combination of technical skills (like programming and statistics) and business-specific knowledge, highlighting the need for well-rounded professionals.
* The presence of skills related to large language models (LLMs) suggests that the industry is quickly adapting to recent advancements in AI.
* The job market has seen a shift toward a strong focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

### Conclusions
* The study provides an updated perspective on the current skill requirements in the Big Data Analytics job market.
* The findings can help students and professionals align their skills with current market needs.
* Academic institutions can use the information to align their curricula with industry demands.
* The study notes the dynamic nature of the field, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and continuous learning.
* The results confirm that the pandemic has increased the industry's focus on machine learning and AI.
* The findings highlight the importance of both hard and soft skills, such as communication.
* The project did not compare the current results with pre-pandemic data, as originally intended, but it provides a strong understanding of the current state of the field.
* The project notes limitations such as the limited time frame of the data collection, and potential misrepresentation of the Quebec market due to language bias.
