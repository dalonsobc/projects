## App Database Assignment
This repository contains my implementation for the "Create an App Database" assignment from my Database course.

The project involves designing and building a database for an app that allows users to book football fields across Ontario and access training services.

Key Features:
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
Designed with a focus on maintaining data integrity and consistency across tables.
- Normalization:
Database normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate partial and transitive dependencies.
- Security:
Passwords are securely stored using hashed fields.
Validation methods ensure that all data entries adhere to integrity constraints.
- Functionality:
Supports insertion, updating, and deletion of users.
Retrieves summary data, such as available fields at specific times.

This project demonstrates the application of database design principles, normalization techniques, and practical database management skills.
