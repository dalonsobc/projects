### Mass Spectra Comparison with Siamese Neural Network

This project implements a Siamese neural network combining 1D-CNN and LSTM layers to perform binary comparison of compound mass spectraâ€”distinguishing whether two spectra belong to the same or different chemical compounds. The project focuses on forensic applications, such as identifying drug family relationships.


## Overview

*Goal*: Learn deep embeddings of 1D mass-spectrometry data for compound comparison using a Siamese architecture.

*Approach*:
- Data preprocessing: normalization, rational transformation, m/z binning
- Pair generation: compound-level split into same/different spectrum pairs
- Model: Siamese network with CNN + LSTM branches
- Loss: Contrastive loss
- Threshold calibration: ROC, AUC, F1-score
- Evaluation: Visualizations (t-SNE), confusion matrices (classifier-based)


## Highlights

- Achieved 99% accuracy on unseen compound pairs using a small NN distance-based classifier.
- Embeddings clearly cluster compound families (validated via t-SNE & Random Forest confusion matrix).
- Designed for generalization to real-world forensic applications.
