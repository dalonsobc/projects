# Indeed Big Data jobs EDA
This code is set to run after we obtained the data set using web scraping techniques. The web scraping part of the project includes running the code for almost half an hour in order to bypass the human verifyer of the indeed website. So this is only the data preprocessing, cleanning and the EDA.
In the case of the markers of the course, you should only run this.
